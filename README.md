Linear Regression from Scratch in Python
This project demonstrates how to build a linear regression model from scratch (without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn) to predict student scores based on study hours.

○ Features:

•Implements gradient descent optimization manually.

•Calculates loss function (MSE) to track training performance.

•Updates slope (m) and intercept (b) using computed gradients.

•Plots the regression line against the data points for visualization.

• Dataset:

•The dataset student_scores.csv contains:

•Hours → Number of hours studied

•Scores → Marks obtained

○ Tech Stack

•Python 3

•Pandas → For dataset handling

•Matplotlib → For data visualization

○ To Run:

•git clone https://github.com/kar-24/linear-regression-scratch.git

•cd linear-regression-scratch

•pip install pandas matplotlib

•python linear_regression.py

○ Output

•Loss values printed during training (every 50 epochs).

•Final slope & intercept values.

•Scatter plot of actual data points with fitted regression line.
